<h3>Development ideas</h3>

<p>Here are some of ideas for development projects
that would be highly valuable to a large number of users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve FLINT's linear algebra performance using vectorization.</li>
<li>Write a tuning framework to automatically select algorithm thresholds on different architectures.</li>
<li>Work on assembly optimisations for specific architectures.</li>
<li>Sparse linear algebra.</li>
<li>Improve algorithms for dealing with exact algebraic and transcendental numbers.</li>
<li>Low-precision interval arithmetic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A longer list of (mostly minor) issues to work on can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/flintlib/flint/blob/main/TODO.md">todo.md</a> file.
